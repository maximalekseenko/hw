This is a repository for my `Inustrial Programming`'s homeworks.


## Running this program
To run program use `build-and-run.sh <lesson number> <task number>`.

To use, you will need c++ (>20) compiler.


## Code Location
In [source folder](./src/) there are multiple folders named with a pattern `p<lesson number>`. Each folder represents separate lessons. 

In each lesson folder there are next files:
* `_main.cpp` - file that used to select task.
* `_task<task number>.h` - files with functions to generate task output.
* other files - solution to given tasks in this lesson.
